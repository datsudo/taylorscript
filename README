Lexical Analyzer for TaylorScript
=================================

This scans all the symbols/lexemes in a TaylorScript
expression or script files supported by TaylorScript
(that ends with .tay file extension).

The program outputs a table with three columns:
- Token type: a category where a symbol belongs to
- Lexeme: the symbol itself that was scanned
- Literal: the value of the token (only for tokens
  such as string or number)
